# Objective

This project is a simple cognitive development test designed to assess different cognitive abilities, including working memory and problem-solving skills. The test consists of two main tasks:

1. **Digit Span Task**: This task tests your working memory by asking you to memorize and recall sequences of digits.
2. **Problem-Solving Task**: This task evaluates your ability to solve simple math problems.

The goal of this project is to provide a fun and interactive way for individuals to assess their cognitive abilities and identify areas of improvement.

## Features

- **Digit Span Task**: Memorize and recall a sequence of numbers of increasing difficulty. Your performance is recorded, and a score is given based on the number of correct recalls.
  
- **Problem Solving Task**: Solve a set of basic math problems. Your performance is recorded, and a score is given based on the number of correct answers.

- **Cognitive Test Summary**: After completing both tasks, the test summarizes your performance and provides feedback based on your scores in working memory and problem-solving.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. **Digit Span Task**

- **Objective**: Memorize and recall a sequence of digits. The task starts with 1 digit and increases in length as you progress through levels.

- **Instructions**: You will be shown a sequence of digits, and after a brief pause, you will be asked to recall the sequence in the same order.

### 2. **Problem Solving Task**

- **Objective**: Solve basic math problems.

- **Instructions**: You will be presented with simple math problems. Enter the correct answer, and the script will provide feedback on whether your answer was correct.
